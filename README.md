**Decisions:** As per the insights from the dashboard company can make the following decisions to boost their sales on week areas.

>1. As we found that sales dropped on the third week of every month so company can give more offers to promote their sales especially on weekdays of every third week in a month since weekdays have lower sales than weekends.
>
>2. Company needs to boost their sales on their business category of hotels, for that they can ti-up with several corporate companies for their business trip planning.
>
>3. Company need to boost their revenue in Cities like Delhi and Hyderabad especially in Hotel Grands as its revenue is low. We found that this hotel has a very low revenue from direct online and offline bookings so they need to find out the root cause for it.

**Why This Matters:** This project has been an incredible learning journey, allowing me to deepen my understanding of data visualization and business intelligence. I'm proud of the insights it can provide and the decisions it can support.

Feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or questions. I'm always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals!
